The [SERRANO](https://ict-serrano.eu) H2020 research project,
a collaborative effort led by [`ICCS`'](https://www.iccs.gr) [High Speed
Communication Networks Lab](http://hscnl.ece.ntua.gr/), successfully concludes,
marking a significant breakthrough in various aspects of cloud- and edge-based
computing technologies. The project aimed to introduce a novel ecosystem
spanning application deployment software components, to systems software
enabling the use of specialized hardware resources. 

One of the key achievements of the SERRANO project is the work carried out by
Nubificus LTD in enabling interoperable hardware acceleration using
[vAccel](https://vaccel.org). Nubificus LTD played a pivotal role in developing
and implementing solutions that allow seamless interoperability among diverse
hardware resources, contributing to enhanced performance and efficiency in
Cloud and Edge computing.

Furthermore, Nubificus LTD has been instrumental in facilitating the deployment
of applications in Cloud and Edge environments through the integration of
secure and efficient container runtimes. Through the development of
[urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc), an open-source, lightweight
container runtime that spawns unikernels as generic containers Nubificus LTD
paved the path for seamless applications deployment at the Edge, maintaining
security standards and efficiency across various computing environments.

SERRANO's ambitious goal of transforming distributed edge, cloud, and HPC
resources into a single borderless infrastructure has been realized through the
efforts of all partners. The project has not only closed existing technology
gaps but has also set the stage for advanced infrastructures capable of meeting
the stringent requirements of future applications and services.

ICT-40-2020 SERRANO Project (H2020 GA No 101017168): Transparent Application Deployment in a Secure, Accelerated and
and Cognitive Cloud Continuum.
SERRANO investigates the transparent deployment of applications in a
secure and accelerated infrastructure of edge, cloud and HPC resources,
based on FPGAs, GPUs, Virtual Platforms and Smart NICs, while
facilitating their automated and cognitive orchestration.
