Cognitive Cloud Continuum, which kicked off in January 2021 and will last three
years. SERRANO consortium consists of 11 partners from industry and academia.
SERRANO investigates the transparent deployment of applications in a secure and
accelerated infrastructure of edge, cloud and HPC resources, based on FPGAs,
GPUs, Virtual Platforms and Smart NICs, while facilitating their automated and
cognitive orchestration.

Nubificus LTD will lead the development of lightweight mechanisms to enable
workload isolation and trusted execution in multi-tenancy nodes, hardware
acceleration abstractions for serverless workloads and the development of
resource orchestration and lightweight virtualization mechanisms.
