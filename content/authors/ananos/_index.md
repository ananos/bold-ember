I am a Researcher in Computer Systems and I am currently working on the
various levels of the systems software stack to attack issues related to
performance, scalability, power-efficiency and security in modern systems. 

Since 2015 I have been affiliated with [UK & EU firms](/#section-experience),
building & architecting solutions for efficient execution of workloads in the
Cloud and at the Edge. I have been involved in many parts of the systems
software stack, including device drivers, memory management, network/block
layers etc. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at
[CSLab](https://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr), [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr) (2014),
where I got my Dipl. Eng. (2006) and my PhD (2013).
